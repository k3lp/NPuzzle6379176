*The N-Puzzle is an Android application based on the classic N-Puzzle game.*


Features:
-------------
* This Android Application has a splash screen.
*	It is possible to play the game in three levels of difficulty. The first level will start a 3-puzzle (3x3). The second level a 4-puzzle (4x4) and the highest level of difficulty will start a 5-puzzle (5x5).
*	On boot, the user is presented with a list of images, any one of which will serve as the basis for the n-puzzle.
* After selecting an image, a new activity will appear that will show the original image for a short amount of time. This image is then broken up into pieces, the amount of pieces depending on the difficulty chosen.
*	The pieces or tiles will be randomly shuffled and one of them will be blank.
*	To solve the puzzle, a user must tap a tile adjacent to this blank tile. This tile will then move to the blank space. 
*	The appâ€™s front side displays a simple game menu button. Clicking this will activate a menu and allow the user to reset the puzzle to a shuffled state, change the difficulty or quit the current game and pick another image.
*	When a game is finished, the app displays either a fail or a win screen/popup.
*	The app can continue the game where you left off.
